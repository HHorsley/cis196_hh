		<h1>A bit about DueCourse...</h1></br>

		<p>We're [relatively] normal, GSR-inhabiting Wharton students like you. We want to learn what we need to, but also to explore what we're curious about. So we teamed up to look for a way to make it easier for the consumers of courses (students) to express unmet interests to the suppliers (professors).</p></br>
		<p>There are classes students want that aren’t being offered by Wharton. Sometimes that’s because it’s deemed infeasible by the faculty. More often, though, these classes don’t happen because there’s no way for the faculty to know that students want them. Right now, the process for a professor to decide to teach a new course involves very little communication with the consumers he/she is looking to serve. It’s not because they don’t want to—often they do—it's because they don’t know who to ask or where to look. Which makes sense!</p></br>
		<p>The goal for DueCourse is to help students communicate what they’re interested in exploring. DueCourse gives these ideas a public home and a way to quantify demand through voting so that faculty can consider seriously these suggestions when thinking about what to teach. We hope to shift the norm in the Wharton course “market” from the 20th century supplier-driven model to the 21st century consumer-driven model (credit: MKTG 101).</p></br>
		<p>Excited to see what weird or brilliant or eclectic ideas emerge. See you on the inside!</p>
