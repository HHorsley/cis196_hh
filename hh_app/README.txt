Issues: I initially installed Rails 4.0 which caused all sorts of issues. Heroku didn't like it. So I went back and changed my version of Rails to 3.2.3 and did it all over again.

What I did: I downloaded RVM to install ruby & rails. Then I made a rails app. Then I edited the index file. Then I pushed it to GitHub and Heroku (I had to create an SSH key too). Then I created this README and pushed that too.
