ISSUES: The formatting of the input/form items is a little wonky. For example, there's a line break between the fullname and email entry boxes. Also, the labels are undesirably close to the entry boxes. I'm sure this could all be remedied with a bit of time/tweaking.

WHAT I DID: I used bootstrap to add data input boxes. I also added an image and a link to my twitter. At this point it's basically looking like a professional page :)

ISSUES: I initially installed Rails 4.0 which caused all sorts of issues. Heroku didn't like it. So I went back and changed my version of Rails to 3.2.3 and did it all over again.

WHAT I DID: I downloaded RVM to install ruby & rails. Then I made a rails app. Then I edited the index file. Then I pushed it to GitHub and Heroku (I had to create an SSH key too). Then I created this README and pushed that too.
